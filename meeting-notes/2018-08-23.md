Notes
=====


* Almost all ventilated patients are on oxygen therapy. Our cohort is the set of patients who are receiving oxygen, the ventilation type should be a cofounder/subgroup.

* Generally, the cofounder extraction should be based on previous work wherever possible.

* All durations should be relative to the admission time, otherwise makes selection criteria too complex.

* Need to consider how we measure the SpO2 quality - the binary "in/out range" is only one method.



General Todo
============

* All parts of the cohort selection should be visualised with histograms. For now, make histogram of LOS.

* We should include full analysis for patients that had different LOS in ICU, e.g., <24 hours, 24-48 hours, >48 hours. Reviewers may think we had selection bias otherwise, we can put in appendix to show conclusions are represntative for the whole cohort.

* Patients may only receive O2 therapy for part of the stay, we should only look at Sp02 at times when recieving O2 therapy.

* Instead of looking for patients who had over 72 O2 measurements, we should have a threshold like 80%.

* Look into other techniques like "META analysis", "Marginal structural model" (the latter may be able to handle temporal fluctuation in use of O2 therapy, search "Miguel Hernan" from Havard). 

* Perhaps cross-validation for our thresholds.

* Look for papers which specify an SpO2 range, to justify our range. Otherwise our range may be viewed as too arbitrary.



Specific Todo
============


| Issue | Followup |
| --- | --- |
| Need to add full set of cofounders for eICU | #18 |
| Detect first ICU stay in eICU | #19 |
| Check that the patient stay is at least 72 hours using the time offset variables | Use "icu_length_of_stay" from "eicu_final_patient_results" |
| Ventilation offsets are incorrect | #12 |
| Make effect histogram | #15 |
| Solve O2 L/% issue | #20 |
| Incorporate external code for O2 therapy/ventilation on eICU | #21 |
